# Assignment 1 - Hello World

Create a bash notebook using Jupyter and explore the commands you
have learned so far.

Objective: Ensure you have a working environment, and begin to
explore working with the command line shell and with Jupyter
notebooks. Find any issues with installation and resolve them.

Steps required:

* Install the [course VM](https://github.com/dchud/warehousing-course/blob/master/README-vm-installation.txt)
* Open up the VM as described
* Open up a terminal, and start jupyter with ```jupyter notebook```
* In the jupyter window, start a new Bash notebook
* ```echo "hello world"``` and execute
* Try out some other commands to get a feel for the shell and navigating the notebook environment (e.g. try Help -> UI Tour, and Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts)
* Give the notebook a clear name like "```assignment-01-chudnov```"
* Acknowledge any assistance you received
* Download as PDF, and download as .ipynb as well
* Zip together: ```zip assignment-01-chudnov.zip assignment-01-chudnov.*```
* Upload your zipfile to blackboard by the deadline
