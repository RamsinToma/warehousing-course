# GWU/GWSB ISTM 6211-11, Data Warehousing / OLAP

Course offered Fall 2015 at GWSB for students in the [MSBA 
program](http://www.gwanalytics.org/), taught by [Dan 
Chudnov](https://github.com/dchud), with materials online at
[https://github.com/dchud/warehousing-course](https://github.com/dchud/warehousing-course).


## Description, from the syllabus:

This course provides a practical grounding in relational databases
with a focus on data warehousing and dimensional modeling, along
with hands-on experience in these tools and other traditional and
contemporary methods for managing and analyzing data at scale, such
as the Unix command line and Apache Spark.  We will focus on using
these tools for the middle phases of data analysis: wrangling,
exploring, and modeling, with an emphasis on delivering reproducible
data analyses.  This course is complementary to other foundational
courses in the Business Analytics program; as such, topics and
techniques from Statistics, Programming, Data Mining, and Optimization
may be present as use cases, but will not be a focal point for
grading.
